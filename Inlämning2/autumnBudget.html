            <p>
              Emily Coltman FCA, chief accountant at FreeAgent, summeries the
              most notable changes in the Chancellor's Autumn Budget and what
              effect they will have on small businesses.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                She explains that "The biggest change that the Autumn Budget
                2017 presented for small business owners was simply that a
                Budget happened in the autumn as well as the spring!" The budget
                announced no significant changes for freelancers, contractors or
                small business owners.
              </p>

          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>No change to the VAT registration threshold for two years</h2>
            <p>
              Since the Office of Tax Simplification published its report on VAT
              in November 2017, there has been speculation as to whether the
              Chancellor would change the threshold for VAT registration in the
              Autumn Budget. The Chancellor opted to freeze the VAT registration
              threshold at its current level of £85,000 for two more years from
              April 2018. In real terms, this could be considered a reduction,
              since usually the threshold rises every year.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>Potential reduction in rates</h2>
            <p>
              Clients who run their businesses from rateable premises will find
              their rates rising by the lower Consumer Prices Index as opposed
              to the Retail Prices Index. And if they were affected by the
              so-called "staircase tax", which meant that businesses using
              office spaces separated by communal stairs, lifts or hallways were
              charged higher rates, they will be able to apply to have that rate
              assessment lowered.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>Making Tax Digital (MTD) plans unchanged</h2>
            <p>
              The Chancellor didn't mention MTD at all in his announcement and,
              digging deeper into the full Budget report, it's apparent that the
              plans for rolling out the initiative haven't changed. MTD will not
              become compulsory until April 2019 and then only for VAT and for
              businesses with annual sales over the VAT threshold.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>Diesel tax increases to affect cars only</h2>
            <p>
              From April 2018, any new diesel cars that do not meet the "clean
              diesel" criteria will be subject to increased car tax. This will
              apply only to cars, not to vans, so clients who own and use a van
              in their business will not have to pay additional tax on it.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>Corporation Tax indexation allowance frozen</h2>
            <p>
              January 2018 will see the freezing of the Corporation Tax
              indexation allowance for chargeable gains made by companies. It
              remains to be seen whether this will be replaced by a taper relief
              similar to that available for individuals.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <h2>Anti-avoidance and the Employment Allowance</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                The budget report claims that the government has "found
                evidence" that employers are claiming the Employment Allowance
                when they are not entitled to do so, "often by using offshore
                arrangements". From 2018, HMRC will "require upfront security"
                from employers who have used the Employment Allowance in this
                way to avoid paying National Insurance in the past.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="budget-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                In summary, while there were a few points of interest for small
                business owners, this Budget can be described very simply as
                "business as usual, no major changes".
