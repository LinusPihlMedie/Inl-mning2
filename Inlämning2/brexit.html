            <p>
              Dean Murry a competition partner at the law firm Ward Hadaway,
              explores the subject of competition after Brexit in the Business
              Quarter (BQ) Spring 2017 edition. One of the big talking points
              facing UK companies post Brexit is "what will happen to
              competition law and how will it affect companies" in the UK?
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <p>
              At present EU competition law greatly influences the competition
              laws in the UK, so after Brexit what will happen to competition.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                Murry asserts that, "the UK's decision to leave he EU added to
                the Prime minister's announcement that the UK does not wish to
                remain in the Single Market, suggests the possibility of a
                change in this area of law post-Brexit. This has the potential
                to create a marked effect on how companies here do business.
                Currently, when competing on a European level, British
                businesses are governed by Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on
                the Functioning of the European Union. These provisions prevent
                the making of unduly restrictive agreements (including cartels),
                as well as preventing dominant businesses abusing their market
                power. These are mirrored on a UK level by the Competition Act
                1998, which for the time being must be interpreted in light of
                European competition case law, although this is likely to cease
                following Brexit."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <h2>What does this mean?</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                In the short term, there will be a "significant difference in
                the UK and European anti-trust policies", however, "in the long
                term there is likely to be a more general divergence. As such,
                there is potential for increased costs and bureaucracy with
                businesses potentially needing different measures in place for
                situations where they compete in both the UK and European
                markets."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <h2>Enforcement of Competition law</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                "The responsibility for competition law enforcement will also
                alter. Under the current arrangement where a business's
                practices have an 'effect on trade between Member States' the
                European Commission will investigate. Where the anti-competitive
                activity is limited to the UK, the Competition and Markets
                Authority (CMA) will consider the matter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Post-Brexit there will be a real possibility of parallel
                investigations with both authorities investigating the same
                matter. This would increase the workload of the CMA, stretching
                its resources as well as increasing the burden and costs for UK
                businesses under investigation."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <h2>Mergers</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                "At the moment company mergers are dealt with on a 'one stop
                shop' principle, whereby a merger with a 'Community Dimension',
                i.e. affecting other EU member states, is dealt with by the
                Commission and all others are dealt by the relevant national
                authority.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, post-Brexit it is likely that many deals will fall
                under the remit of both EU and national regimes – meaning
                purchasers may be obliged to make two merger filings. This is
                undesirable for a number of reasons including the fact that the
                UK merger process is lengthier than the EU process, and that the
                CMA charges a filing fee of £160,000 whereas there is no such
                fee for reporting mergers to the Commission.
              </p>
              <p>
                This arrangement could also lead to a situation also lead to
                situations where the two authorities reach a different
                conclusion as to the permissibility of a proposed acquisition.
                Therefore, companies should be sure to reconsider their existing
                merger filing approaches as well as reviewing the commerciality
                of proposed deals more generally."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <h2>State Aid</h2>
            <p>
              Competition law also encompasses State Aid. "Currently, it is
              dealt with solely on a European level and there are no equivalent
              provisions under UK law. State Aid requirements are also only
              applicable to Member States, meaning that, post-Brexit, the UK
              will be allowed to provide aid to businesses without fear of
              European action. However, the UK will be bound by the World Trade
              Organisation Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures,
              which controls a country's use of financial subsidies in addition
              to providing remedies to counter any adverse effects. Nonetheless,
              the effects of this are less stringent than the current European
              requirements."
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="brexit-section">
            <h2>Could the loss of these restrictions be an advantage?</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                Murry explains that "the loss of such restrictions does not mean
                the Government will automatically look to exploit its new-found
                freedom. Further, it is possible the Government will seek to
                impose new national laws to restrict the ability of other state
                bodies to assist businesses.
              </p>
              <p>
                State aid provisions have helped the UK by curtailing the
                financial support grant to businesses in other Member States.
                Such influence will be lost following Brexit, resulting in the
                potential for European growth that may be undesirable for UK
                business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whilst much of the rhetoric surrounding the EU referendum was
                about lightening the regulatory load, the burden when it comes
                to competition issues could actually become greater for UK
                business post-Brexit.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is perhaps another illustration that the most significant
                legal issue in the context of Brexit is the application of the
                law of unintended consequences."
