              Tom Herbert of AccountingWEB's business editor writes that "HMRC
              is hitting smaller 'eBay style' internet traders who underpay
              their tax with tougher penalties than larger businesses, according
              to new figures released by Moore Stephens."
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="penalties-section">
            <p>
              Figures from the Top Ten firm showed that online retailers fined
              for unpaid tax under HMRC's 'deliberate defaulters' programme
              faced average penalties (on top of the underpaid tax) of 59% of
              the tax owed, compared to the overall average of around 35-50%.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="penalties-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                However, AccountingWEB were advised by a spokesperson from HMRC,
                that the firm had reached this figure by analysing just five
                cases, says Tom.
              </p>

            <h2>Lack of awareness</h2>
            <p>
              Many small-scale traders using online outlets such as eBay, Amazon
              and Alibaba may be unaware they have to pay tax on their activity,
              or believe their earnings will fly under HMRC's radar.
            </p>
            <p>
              From April 2017, online retailers are allowed to earn up to £1,000
              annually without being taxed, but many quickly outgrow that
              exemption.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="penalties-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                Moore Stephens partner Dominic Arnold, believes that the Revenue
                is cracking down on such traders with 'full force'.
              </p>
              <p>
                "HMRC has given due warning to online traders that they are in
                their sights," said Arnold. "In HMRC's eyes there can be no
                excuses for not declaring online businesses. However, many
                sellers might not consider the fact they should be paying tax
                and are not even registered with HMRC".

            <h2>
              Recent examples of cases flagged by Moore Stephens included:
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                An online car accessory retailer from Bradford who defaulted on
                tax worth £71,738 between 2011 and 2014 faced penalties worth
                £50,217 – 70% of tax owed
              </li>
              <li>
                An online sole trader antique dealer from London who defaulted
                on tax worth £26,399 and faced penalties of £17,555 – 66% of tax
                owed
              </li>
              <li>
                An online retailer of mobile phone accessories from Leicester
                who defaulted on tax worth £31,418 and owed penalties of £20,343
                – 65% of tax owed
              </li>
              <li>
                An online retailer from Glasgow whose tax defaults totalled
                £34,176 and faces penalties of £20,335 – 59% of tax owed
              </li>
              <li>
                An online textile retailer from Manchester that defaulted taxes
                worth £62,702, faced penalties of £35,113 – 56% of tax owed
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="penalties-section">
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                Reacting to the figures an HMRC spokesperson said: "We are clear
                that everyone must play by the same rules, and pay the taxes due
                under the law. This applies to online trading as to more
                traditional platforms. When you are selling goods for profit,
                HMRC must be notified through the trader's tax return.
              </p>
              <p>
                "Our penalties are focused on the minority of people who try to
                get around the rules. Our most recent figures show that last
                year HMRC brought in a record £26bn in extra tax for our public
                services, money that would otherwise have gone unpaid."
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="penalties-section">
            <h2>Card transaction programme</h2>
            <p>
              HMRC opened a new "card transaction programme" disclosure facility
              this March. The scheme is designed to offer lower penalties to
              businesses volunteering potential under-payment information.
            </p>
            <div class="highlight">
              <p>
                However, Moore Stephens cautioned that because HMRC extracts
                data from businesses that process debit and credit card
                transactions, it remains relatively easy for the Revenue to
                track down even the smallest of organisations that fails to pay
                the right amount of tax.
