          <h2>VAT RETURNS</h2>
          <p>
            The complete VAT Returns service, includes everything you need from
            registration to submission.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will need to file VAT Returns and/or register for VAT if your
            turnover is more than the current specified VAT threshold. Some
            businesses may choose to register for VAT voluntarily. However,
            making this business decision can become confusing. We can offer you
            advice regarding VAT, tailored to your needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your VAT returns are straightforward, then it is more cost
            effective to complete them yourself. However, online VAT returns are
            not as simplistic as you may think. If you are using an online
            accounts software, chances are you could be entitled to a VAT
            refund, and this can be very complex. Outsourcing your VAT returns
            to us will give you peace of mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will check your bookkeeping, ensuring that there are no
            discrepancies, because having discrepancies will render your VAT
            return incorrect. Once we are confident that your bookkeeping is
            correct, we will send the figures to you for review. When you revert
            back to us confirming that you are happy for us to submit the VAT
            Return, we will file your VAT returns to HMRC.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will also make you aware if your business will exceed the VAT
            threshold, allowing sufficient time for you to take action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another advantage of using our service is in the event of a VAT
            inspection. HMRC launch investigations into the VAT affairs of
            businesses at random or as a result of inconsistently submitted
            figures. By appointing us as your Accountant to process your VAT
            returns, you can have the peace of mind that the figures submitted
            to HMRC are accurate.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you would like us to act on your behalf for VAT and submit your
            VAT Returns, please contact us. All our fees are agreed at the
            initial consultation before any work is conducted.

          <h2>BUSINESS PLANS</h2>
          <p>
            We create formal statements of business goals, detailing reasons why
            they are attainable and offer plans for achieving them. Our business
            plans are customised, professionally written and bespoken, as we
            collate background information about you and your business at our
            initial meeting, and through the creative process. Creating business
            plans in this way allows you to understand your business and your
            options for future development.
          </p>
          <p>
            We specialise in creating business plans for start-ups, funding
            applications, and growth ventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our business plans are delivered complete with two years detailed
            profit and loss, cash-flow and management information analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            A business plan created by us will be designed specifically for the
            intended audience, whether a lender or an investor. The business
            plan will include the following:

            If you require payroll for the first time but are not in a position
            to run it yourself, or would prefer that it was handled by an
            expert. We will manage the set-up of your PAYE scheme, and update
            you on the required payments due to staff and HMRC. There is no
            minimum requirement for our payroll service, so if your payroll
